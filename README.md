# About the Project

The inception of House Of Bliss stems from a deeply personal journey through the realms of gentle medicine and natural products. In a society where stress has become rampant, we offer a sanctuary where self-care becomes a priority. Our eShop is more than just a platform; it's a holistic haven for those seeking to infuse their lives with the essence of aromatherapy.

This venture is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, encapsulating my fervor for alternative healing and the essence of essential oils in everyday life. The idea was sown from a seed of belief – belief that everyone deserves a moment of bliss, an escape from the fast-paced turmoil of daily life.
